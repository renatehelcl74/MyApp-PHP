# Technical Specification

## Project Setup

The project will be structured as a PHP application with Composer for dependency management. The application will follow a clean architecture pattern with minimal external dependencies.

## Backend Stack

- **PHP 8.2+**: Utilizing modern PHP features including named arguments, attributes, and strict typing
- **Composer**: For dependency management and autoloading
- **Native PHP Sessions**: For user authentication and session management
- **PDO**: For database connectivity with prepared statements
- **PHP-FPM**: For serving the application

## Frontend Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For client-side interactivity
- **Fetch API**: For AJAX requests to the backend

## Development Workflow

1. PHP source files will be managed via Composer's autoloader
2. Tailwind CSS will be compiled using the Tailwind CLI
3. JavaScript will be written in modular format and included directly (no bundler required)

## Deployment

The application will be deployable on any standard PHP hosting environment with PHP 8.2+ support and appropriate database connectivity.
